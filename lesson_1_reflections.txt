1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It helped seperate the content that wasn't 
changed from the content that was changed.
By doing this there were less lines of code to go through and it was easier to see what was wrong.
It also gave a + and - to desinate if it was changed or removed.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can go through and see the changes and edits, some things that work together and some that don't.
Also if you need to have a place to start over or compare to see what you did different.

Pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit like in Git, vs having versions autosaved like google docs does?

If you forget to save and or you didn't save and made major changes and it doesn't work and you can't
go back.


Make sure you can start your editor from the terminal

If you use Sublime you can do this by add the line to your .bash_profile
alias subl="/Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl"

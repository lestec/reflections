What happens when you initialize a repsitory?
Why do you need to do it?
You create a directory in sense. Than you need
to make a commit for it to all come together.

How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers? 
stagging area is a place to add file to like a clipboard
in a way, then commit what files are in there to the 
repo. wking directory on your hard drive, computer.
It offers the value of not having to commit everything
you can pick and choose what you want in there. Also
it offers a way to write a commit message so you know what 
changes have been made.
